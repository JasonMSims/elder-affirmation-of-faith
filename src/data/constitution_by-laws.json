            "The Bible does not explicitly comment on the ultimate fate of children who die in infancy, or on persons who have not the cognitive maturity to make willful moral decisions. Nevertheless, the Scriptural evidence is encouraging as it implies that such persons are elect, regenerated, and saved by Christ through the Spirit who works when and how He pleases.<reference> God is able, through the Holy Spirit, to work in, fill, and set apart infants for His elective purposes.<reference> While every person has inherited Adam's sin and guilt, no man answers for Adam's sin, but for his own deeds.<reference> Nevertheless, we are provided encouraging hints regarding God's intention towards the youngest of children. In God's dealing with Israel in the wilderness, we clearly see God's recognition that the youngest of children have no knowledge of good and evil and exempts them from the punishment to be received by their fathers. In the Pentateuch, the “Knowledge of Good and Evil” is associated with willful deeds of rebellion against God in mind and body. In Genesis 3, man is banished from the land (Eden), forbidden to return to God's place of rest because of his refusal to trust God.<reference> In Deuteronomy 1, rebellious man is once again forbidden to enter into the land of rest (Canaan), for the exact same sin.<reference> But the children of such rebels, who cognitively are in no place to rebel in such a way, are permitted to enter in.<reference> It is not insignificant to the discussion that both Eden and Canaan are types and shadows of God's ultimate rest in the New Heavens and New Earth.<reference> Today, believers whose children die in such a state of undeveloped cognitive ability can have hope, like King David,<reference> to see their departed children in heaven, the ultimate place of rest for the people of God. On the other hand, the Bible does not explicitly state how we would know when a young child is specifically in such a state and when he or she isn't. Therefore, as a child grows in cognitive maturity, presumption is ill-advised. Because of the presence of original sin and Adam's imputed guilt in infants, the cross of Jesus Christ and His blood is still necessary to fully and finally deal with sin.<reference>"
